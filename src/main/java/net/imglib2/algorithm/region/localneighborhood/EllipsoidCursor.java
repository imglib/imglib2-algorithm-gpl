/**
 * This class implements a {@link Cursor} that iterates over all the pixel
 * within the volume of a 3D ellipsoid. It is made so that if the ellipsoid
 * volume is made of N pixels, this cursor will go exactly over N iterations
 * before exhausting.
 * <p>
 * The center of the sphere is set by a {@link EllipsoidNeighborhood} position,
 * allowing to use this cursor in neighborhood processing operations. The two
 * cursors (this one and the main one) are not linked in any way, so the method
 * to move the sphere center must be called every time. For instance:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Img&lt;T&gt; img;
 * // ...
 * long[] span = new long[] { 10, 20, 5 };
 * EllipsoidNeighborhood&lt;T&gt; ellipsoid = new EllipsoidNeighborhood&lt;T&gt;(img);
 * ellipsoid.setSpan(span);
 * Cursor&lt;T&gt; cursor = ellipsoid.cursor();
 * while (mainCursor.hasNext()) {
 * 	mainCursor.fwd();
 * 	ellipsoid.setPosition(mainCursor);
 * 	cursor.reset();
 * 	while (cursor.hasNext()) {
 * 		cursor.fwd();
 * 		// Have fun here ...
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The iteration order is always the same. Iteration starts from the middle Z
 * plane, and fill circles away from this plane in alternating fashion:
 * <code>Z = 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, ...</code>. For each circle, lines are drawn in
 * the X positive direction from the middle line and away from it also in an
 * alternating fashion: <code>Y = 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, ...</code>. To parse all the
 * pixels, a line-scan algorithm is used, relying on McIlroy's algorithm to
 * compute ellipse bounds efficiently. It makes intensive use of states to avoid
 * calling the {@link Math#sqrt(double)} method.
